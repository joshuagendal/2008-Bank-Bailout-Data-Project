DESCRIPTION

I turned a political dataset I developed as an undergraduate in college into a web application that allows users to interact with this political data. 

As an undergraduate student at Florida State University, I wrote several political science research papers. One of these papers, and the most advanced, was for my Senior Honors Thesis. My topic was the 2008 Bank Bailout, and my research question was "Why did 58 Members of the House of Representatives switch their vote, from "no" to "yes", on the 2008 Bank Bailout legislation?"(The 2008 Bank Bailout is AKA the Paulson Proposal or the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008). 

I used Stata to build my relation data set on 434 members of the House of Representatives, and i also used it to analyze the data. I converted the Stata.dta file to a pandas dataframe using the pandas python library. I then imported the columns from this pandas DF to columns in my SQLite database.
